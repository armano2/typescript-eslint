# Migrating from TSLint to ESLint

If you are looking for help in migrating from TSLint to ESLint, you can check out this project: https://github.com/typescript-eslint/tslint-to-eslint-config

You can look at [`the plugin ROADMAP.md`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin/ROADMAP.md) for an up to date overview of how TSLint rules compare to the ones in this package.

There is also the ultimate fallback option of using both linters together for a while during your transition if you absolutely have to by using TSLint _within_ ESLint. For this option, check out [`@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin-tslint`](../ESLINT_PLUGIN_TSLINT.md).
